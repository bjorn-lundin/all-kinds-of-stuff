          THE QUICK 'N EASY INSTALL GUIDE


THIS DOCUMENT ASSUMES:
----------------------

 - you are compiling for UNIX/Linux platform
 - you are using GNAT as the Ada compiler
 - you are using gcc as the C compiler
 - that you have ADA_INCLUDE_PATH defined and exported
 - that you have ADA_OBJECTS_PATH defined and exported
 - that you have a suitably modern version of PostgreSQL and/or..
   MySQL database installed
 - that the C library libpq is available (if using PostgreSQL)
 - that the C library libmysql is available (if using MySQL)


NOTES ABOUT OPTIMIZATION:
-------------------------

 - The Makefile that is shipped to you should have a
   parameter OPTZ=-O0 set (if not, then you should
   set it to that).
 - GNAT 3.14p seems to have difficulty when the 
   optimization level is raised beyond this. If
   using a newer compiler, you may want to try
   OPTZ=-O1 (test using the ./eg example build)


USERS WITH PRIOR VERSIONS OF APQ INSTALLED
------------------------------------------

   You should either remove the references to the original
   APQ directories (source and library), or eliminate
   them prior to installing this version.

   APQ Versions 1.92 and prior:
    Remove all:
      postgresql*.ad[sb] package spec and bodies
      postgresql*.ali and .o files
      libapq.a file

   APQ Version 1.93 and later:
    Remove all:
      apq*.ad[sb] package spec and bodies
      apq*.ali and .o files
      libapq.a file

   If you have the original source distribution, you
   may do a 'make uninstall', provided that you 
   choose the correct directory to uninstall from.


INSTALLING APQ FOR THE FIRST TIME:
----------------------------------

 1. Make sure your PATH gives access to all database
    tools of interest (eg. PostgreSQL and MySQL)
 2. ./configure  (This creates Makeincl file)
 3. make
 4. make install (as root, if necessary)

    Account root is NOT needed if your ADA_*_PATH directory(ies)
    are directories that you have permissions on (you can delete
    and create entries in those directories).

 TO REBUILD:

 1. make uninstall
 2. make clobber
 3. Repeat the above steps

 MAKE ERROR?

   $ make
   Makefile:7: Makeincl: No such file or directory
   make: *** No rule to make target `Makeincl'.  Stop.

   This indicates a ./configure needs to be run.


CUSTOM INSTALLS:
----------------

   By default, APQ tries to compile for every database
   supported that you have installed. The configure
   script obtains configuration information from pg_config
   for PostgreSQL, and mysql_config for MySQL. These
   tools must be on your search PATH for this to work
   obviously.

   WHAT IF I WANT TO DISABLE SUPPORT?

   If you have both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases
   installed, but one of them is giving you grief
   and you want to bypass support for it (without
   uninstalling it), this is possible. See below.

   BUILDING WITHOUT POSTGRESQL:

   1. make clobber      (If necessary)
   2. HAVE_PG=0 ./configure
   3. make

   BUILDING WITHOUT MYSQL:

   1. make clobber      (If necessary)
   2. HAVE_MY=0 ./configure
   3. make


TESTING THE APQ BINDING:
------------------------

   *** WARNING ***

   THESE TESTS CREATE AND DROP THE FOLLOWING DATABASE NAMES:

      apq_pg            in PostgreSQL
      apq_my            in MySQL

   IF YOU ALREADY HAVE DATABASES NAMED AS ABOVE, DO NOT
   RUN THE TESTS AS THEY ARE!

   *** END WARNING ***

   1. cd ./eg2          (This tests MySQL and/or PostgreSQL)
   2. make clobber
   3. make create_pg    (PostgreSQL)
   or make create_my    (MySQL)
   4. make check_pg     (PostgreSQL)
   or make check_my     (MySQL)
   5. make release_pg   (PostgreSQL)
   or make release_my   (MySQL)

The test program may report some problems about your /etc/passwd and/or
/etc/group files. You should follow up on any of these error reports.

DISCLAIMER: Note however, this example program by no means represents a
complete check of your /etc/passwd and /etc/group files however! It
merely serves as an example framework.


POSTGRESQL ONLY TEST:
---------------------

   *** WARNING ***

   THESE TESTS CREATE AND DROP THE FOLLOWING DATABASE NAME:

      apq_pg

   IF YOU ALREADY HAVE DATABASES NAMED AS ABOVE, DO NOT
   RUN THE TESTS AS THEY ARE!

   *** END WARNING ***

   1. cd ./eg		(change to test directory)
   2. make		(compile test sources)
   3. make create	(create & load database apq_eg)
   4. make test		(run tests on tables in apq_eg)
   5. make release	(discard the apq_eg database)

The test program may report some problems about your /etc/passwd and/or
/etc/group files. You should follow up on any of these error reports.

DISCLAIMER: Note however, this example program by no means represents a
complete check of your /etc/passwd and /etc/group files however! It
merely serves as an example framework.
