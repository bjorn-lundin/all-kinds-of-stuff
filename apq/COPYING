	COPYING APQ
	===========

I hate complicated licensing, but unfortunately it is somewhat necessary
here:


PostgreSQL Sources:
-------------------

The modified or unmodified copies of the PostgreSQL Database Management
System (formerly known as Postgres, then as Postgres95) software sources
are covered under a separate license (see file PG_COPYRIGHT for the
precise terms).


APQ Sources:
------------

As of Aug 4, 2002, the APQ Binding source code is available under a
dual-license agreement. You the user or distributor, can choose one of
the following sets of terms, that best suits your needs:

	1. The ACL (Ada Community License) : see file ACL.txt
or
	2. The GPL2 license (GNU Public License 2) : see GPL.txt

One or the other license must cover all APQ source code that is not
otherwise covered by the PostgreSQL license.

The distributor and the end user(s) can choose different licenses, if
they wish. The intention of this dual license agreement is to protect
your freedom to access, use and even modify the source code for your own
use.

Please enjoy, Warren.
